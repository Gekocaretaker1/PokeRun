PokeRun! Pseudocode
PokeRun! is a free-roam, tile-map, game based on all the pokemon games, without the story lines; meaning the player can do what they want.
The first region is the most important, so for now, only the Kanto region will be added, but PokeRun! will be designed for adding more later.

Start of pseudocode:

When player runs PokeRun!, it will get the os.name property and depending on which os the player is using:
if os.name is win, go to the folder of <user.home> and if the "pokerun" folder and child folders do not exist, it will create them,
	and then put needed data into a hidden folder at "<user.home>/pokerun/data", and other data, like regions, skins, and other stuff into
	a folder called "<user.home>/pokerun/customization"
if os.name is nix, nux, aix, mac, or sunos, go to the folder of <user.home> and if the "pokerun" folder and child folders do not exist, it will
	create them, and then put needed data into a hidden folder at "<user.home>/pokerun/.data", and the other data, like regions, skins,
	and other stuff into a folder called "<user.home>/pokerun/customization"

Then, it will write the needed data to the correct folders. There will be region files, named in a region format like so:
	<!><r><!><e><!><g><!><i><!><o><!><n><!>.dat
	The format is a random alphanumerical character in between each letter of the region name.

The reason for using .dat instead of .zip, is that people will not know that it is easily editable data. The files will also be read only.
	There will be an extra script that will be used to delete all PokeRun! data. This will be a highly dangerous script, so it will give 2 prompts about deletion.
	If people use the customization folder, they will just use zip files.
